What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Initializing a repo with git init means we configure the current directory with
git to act as a repo. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

Staging area acts as an intermediate between the two stages. It lets us
control the git repo with more fine tuned personalizations.
