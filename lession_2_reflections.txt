What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Initializing a repo with git init means we configure the current directory with
git to act as a repo. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

Staging area acts as an intermediate between the two stages. It lets us
control the git repo with more fine tuned personalizations.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

After each change I can add my change to staging area and use git diff as well 
as git diff --staged to verify if im adding one logical change.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history 
organized? How would branches help?

Branches can be used for making experimental features but still want to make
sure we have a working directory.
