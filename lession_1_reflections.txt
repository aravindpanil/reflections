How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

diff is an inbuilt tool in linux which highlighted when lines of code were 
changed. The different lines of code were highlighted with + and - signs.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more 
efficient programmer in the long term?

Easy to access to older versions makes it easier to roll back in case of a 
mistake. It also makes highlighting mistakes and changes easier. 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a 
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
Docs does?

Automatically saved versions has the advantage of not having to remember to 
save or accidentally losing an unsaved file due to technical errors.Manual 
saving offers much more fine tuning of the saving and lets us make logical
commits.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log is used to see the history of all commits made with id and a commit 
title. git diff is used to see changes between two commits in an easy readable
manner.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that 
could break something?

version control lets us change code without having to be afraid as it lets us 
revert back to an old version very easily.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

I will be using git as a dvc for all my future projects to get used to it.
